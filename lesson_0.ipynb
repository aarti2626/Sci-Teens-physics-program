    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant for you to practice how to run code in this file to help you throughout the course. Also, don't worry about understanding the code as we will learn about what it means on day one. \n",

    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are, at their core, environments that allow us to write and **interpret** our code in real time. There are many programming languages that can be used in these notebooks including Python, R, Julia, and Matlab. However, in this course, we will be concentrating on Python.\n",
