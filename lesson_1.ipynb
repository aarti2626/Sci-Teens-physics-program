    "\n",
    "Welcome, and thanks for joining us! In this four-part course, you will learn the basic concepts of one of the world's most popular coding languages (i.e. Python) and dive into the field of Data Science. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we teach, please make sure to ask plenty of questions on anything you're confused about and never hesitate to let us know if we're moving too quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, \n",
    "- If you've never used a Jupyter Notebook (i.e. the file you are currently on), make sure to try this 5-minute tutorial. \n",
    "- We _highly_ encourage you to experiment with the code and datasets in these files.  If you break anything, close the tab and open the activity again to start over.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will have two main things. The first is a toolkit that is essential in _any_ field (e.g. science, business, robotics, etc.) you choose to explore. The second is a jumping off point in any research you do decide to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by learning about Data Science!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data](https://media.giphy.com/media/hOzfvZynn9AK4/giphy.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Data Science? \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Data science, we must know these two definitions: \n",
    "- **Data**: pieces of information \n",
    "- **Dataset**: allows you to store data in an organized way \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we were to give you this piece of data:\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">AK,2015,Olivia,56 </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For it to be useful, we must label it. Therefore, let's label \"AK\" as a state, \"2015\" as a year, \"Olivia\" as a name, and \"56\" as number of babies. Given the data with labels, we can deduce that in 2015 there were 56 babies called Olivia in Arkansas. If we modify any label, it makes a drastic difference in our interpretation of the data. For example, by changing \"56\" to be the number of dogs instead of babies, we conclude that in 2015 there were 56 dogs named Olivia in Arkansas which is different from our original conclusion above. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a large amount of data, we can start to find meaningful patterns called **trends**. These simply describes the general direction of the data. Some examples include: \n",
    " \n",
    "- X is increasing.\n",
    "- Y is moving upward.\n",
    "- Z is the same. \n",
    "- R is changing at a faster rate than Y.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A more relevent example is given a dataset containing the names of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the USA and the month they were, we can find if the number of cases in the USA is increasing, decreasing, or the same. \n",
    "  \n",
    "The people who find these trends are those who study Data Science. It's defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The application of data centric, computational,and inferential thinking to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the world (science)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Solve problems (engineering)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, it is the study of data with the goal of extracting useful information about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, data scientists combine aspects of statistics, computer science, and mathematics. However, we'll soon see that just because Data Science has these fields at its core it doesn't mean that it's limited to them. In reality, Data Science has a role in virtually any STEM (i.e. Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) field you can imagine. In this course, we'll be applying data science to the field of Ecology.\n"

    "\n",
    "Just like in this world we have different languages like Spanish, English, Italian, and so forth, computers have many languages as well. There are over 500 hundred computer languages. Some of these languages are called Java, C#, Python, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will be using Python to analyze data. By using this language, your computer can understand it the code you write.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a piece of code, you are writing what's known as an **algorithm**. This is a step-by-step set of instructions which tell the computer what to do. It is important to know that the computer will _only_ do what you tell it to and will not infer any step even if it's obvious to you. Therefore, you must be specific at every step. If you aren't, your program will not work. By writing an algorithm in a language your computer understands (e.g. Python), you can build anything!\n",

    "### Primitive Types\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before we start learning a language, we must know the basic building blocks of it. In a computer language, such as Python, these blocks are called **primitive types**. These primitive types are the basis of computer languages just like letters are to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, these are the primitive types: \n",

    "To analyze data, we might do some sort of math computation. In a computer language, the multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction symbols are known as **operators**.\n",
